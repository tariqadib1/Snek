# Snek
Hell yeah.

Had a good time making this. Hope you enjoy tinkering with it. 
The snake doesnt teleport accross screen edges tho. I've hard coded it to stay inside and keep taking rights at screen corners.

Now. Customize:

Line 22: Turn off the logging. 

Line 39,35: 50,50 is the size of the food. Its just a large grey square in the current iteration, and increase/decrease as you see fit

Line 63: Initial length of the snake

Line 68: Turn off kiddie mode by toggling hasEdgeDeath to true
